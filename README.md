# Text Sprite ![Build status badge](https://github.com/microsoft/arcade-text/workflows/MakeCode/badge.svg)

## Usage

This extension allows you to create "text sprites" which are just sprites created with the visual appearance of text. All standard behavior and APIs for sprites apply to them. In addition, the Text Sprite extension has helpful blocks for working with and changing the appearance of text sprites.

Note that when unicode characters are in use, the font height used in text sprites will always be a multiple of 12px. Whereas otherwise we prefer to use multiples of height 8px or 5px fonts.
